This would be natural a large disappointment. This year is it to us really because of the heart to cream off this title. In the last season we were close to. In May we were disappointed, since we were strong enough, in order to carry the victory off. We terminated the season with a very strong achievement. We locked with 79 points. Normally one should be with 79 points masters… But another crew, that one of Montpellier, obtained a still better season. I believe that this year is the correct. Even if the large crews struggle such as Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux for the title, I believe that we have things to win him.

The liberal-oriented economies in the EU and in the globalised world are based on the principle of unregulated economic competition. In effect, this means that the individual economies are in permanent conflict with each other. The principle of free trade and the free, unrestricted movement of private capital that goes hand in hand with rampant financial speculation. Due to the large differences of the value of work (wages), there will be price tensions. Under this concept is a condition to understand where the manufacturer is trying to insist by importing cheaper goods in economic competition in the competition "undercut" in order to seize a larger share of the market and to increase its profits. In a large-scale means that for most companies to move their production abroad or buy cheap there, or to give up their business, and the result is a high level of unemployment in countries with similarly high labour costs. Since the private capital needs no social responsibility and therefore bears no responsibility for the unemployment caused by him, rising government spending. This situation is further reinforced by the fact that the two entrepreneurs are absolutely unwilling to pay their taxes and to replace this society of economic and social damage caused by them. This situation is well known, so precise statistics are unnecessary at this point. The reckless practice of private capital creates a situation in which governments are forced to engage in competition with each other in the individual economies to artificially lower the level of social security of its own people and to attract foreign capital into the country. In other words, the governments will deliver its own people without regard to the social consequences of the private capital. This is particularly true in modifications of existing laws. The aim of these measures is to force its own people to accept the dictates of private capital, especially in terms of wages. This is partly by economic coercion in long-term unemployment and on the other by restricting the rights of workers. The results are growing poverty and widening disparities between rich and poor. Germany has been around for a number of years public food distribution points for the poor, who are no longer able to feed themselves through their own work. The number of victims is already in the millions. In the wake of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy is on a regular basis to cases in which such a low wage workers maintain that the state must increase their income by subsistence level. Such a scandal was uncovered in the case of auxiliary staff working in the German Bundestag. The austerity measures virtually all the EU's southern states will undoubtedly amount to the same state in which, under the pressure of a catastrophic crash of their social level, people are forced to emigrate (as was the case in the 19th century), or for a pittance to languish on the margins of society, and we hope that some private investment capital is flowing into the country. Here is the question of where this capital comes from nature? If it comes from another EU country, only moves of poverty from one country to another, or capital remains the same, because in China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Morocco or Egypt or in Africa at all the employees are working for a fraction of the European wages. This concerns all of Latin America. Liberal theories and media claim ad nauseam that the state should not involved with capital of its own economy, and that a planned economy leads to economic disaster. The private capital insisted blinkered in its position that the state should not interfere lenkend in the economy. Then you have to ask, however, if not the private capital of the policy and that affects the entire state in our own selfish sense or even draws. Here is the clear answer: Yes. The proof is the existence of a virtually omnipotent and omnipresent in all states lobby. The result is a desperate situation in the area of corruption, reciprocal privileges, a law in which virtually everything reprehensible, but nothing is punishable by law. The situation is such that a State Department without private finances closely interdependent with the industry in Germany right companies charged with drawing up draft legislation. These bills are then passed in the Bundestag. The violence is no longer from the people of how to declare the Western constitutions, but by strong financial groups, who prefer their own interests. Apparently caught the liberal democracies are currently in a situation as it quickly Appian describes in his book on the crisis of the Roman Republic at the time of Caesar and Pompeius': "The state has long understood the collapse, and the offices were occupied by force. Against bribes, through illegal bequiles of benefits or with stone and sword. The corruption proliferated already bought votes with abandon, and the people went to the polls... "" people with character is not applied for positions, so that the state had no consul for eight months as a result of this decline. "" You really started to talk about it that the only medicine in this difficult situation is an autocracy, and that a strong man should be chosen "Appian thought is to him, but the strong man was finally Caesar, who replaced the democracy on a permanent basis by the autocracy.

Because even if the corpuscle physics is a really strange world, it turns out that also such a law applies to them: the Pauli'sche exclusion principle that says that two corpuscles cannot fill the same room at the same time, when they are in the same "quantum state", at which this "state" on the whole consists of some of their properties. Of that going out the physicists split up the corpuscles in two categories one. The good citizens who are called Fermione and in a well-behaved way obey to the Pauli exclusion principle are in a corner. And in the other one those ones move bosons, a bad gang of anarchists to whom nothing is holy - in any case not this principle, what means that they can be in the action at the same time at the same place.
